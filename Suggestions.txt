-If you want more simplicity, Either use conftest or basetest. but it's fine to use the conftest to set up the methods for screenshots
-easier to setup a basetest with everything you need and then inherit it rather than setting up conftest with the fixtures,
if comfortable with it then only use conftest
- when cloned into my system, tests couldn't be run without me refactoring the conftest to be in the test file, once I did that, the screenshots are also showing up in the required folder
- I would suggest restructuring it to be the same with just a few changes:
    -Main folder(Deepti_Basnet_Foodmandu)
        -Pages
            -Home
            -Login
            -etc
        -Tests
            -screenshot
            -reports
            -test1
            -test2
        -Setup
            -basetest
        conftest.py
        pytest.ini
